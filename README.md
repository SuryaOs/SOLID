# SOLID Principles in C#

Welcome to the SOLID Principles in C#! This repository is dedicated to demonstrating the principles of software design that make up the SOLID acronym: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. By following these principles, you can create maintainable, scalable, and robust C# code.

## Introduction

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help developers create well-structured and maintainable code.

This repository provides practical examples and code snippets in C# to illustrate how each of the SOLID principles can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change. It should have only one responsibility or job.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It's better to have multiple, smaller interfaces than one large, monolithic one.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

## Examples

In this repository, you will find practical examples for each SOLID principle in C# code. Each principle has its own folder with code samples and explanations.
